Hello and welcome to my portfolio ‚úåÔ∏è

I have a profound passion for web development, a journey that commenced through self-education. Every project and obstacle encountered further ignites my inspiration as I delve into novel technologies and confront intricate challenges. In tandem with my fervor for web development, I hold a steadfast dedication to knowledge dissemination. I enthusiastically contribute to the community by imparting the insights I've acquired.

There are two types of project in this portfolio.

- On the one hand, the so-called "professional" projects where I apply all my knowledge and clean code to be as professional as possible in my approach.

- On the other hand, the so-called "experimental" projects where I learn new development technologies/tools.

Don't wait any longer! Immerse yourself in my world and let's take a journey together üòä
